**Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

## How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-issue-tracker/issues). 

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, which template have you used, what are the input values you passed and what version of module you are using etc, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
